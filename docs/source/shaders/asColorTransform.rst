****************
asColorTransform
****************

A node that transforms a color from **any** input color model, to **any**
output color model, respecting the color space definitions (the chromaticity
coordinates of the RGB primaries, and the white point).
It has the option to automatically pick up the color space and white point
from the settings defined in Maya's synColor color management preferences, but
the user has the option to override this.
